## Exercise: Replacing Bools
 
 The following struct describes a type of enemy in a game:
 */
enum Weapons{
    case none, sword, rubberMallet
}

struct Enemy {
    let strength: Int
    let speed: Int
    var weapon: Weapons
    
}
var teste = Enemy(strength: 2, speed: 2, weapon: .sword)


print(teste)
/*:
 As your game has developed, youâ€™ve decided that your enemies might have more than one type of weapon.

 - callout(Exercise): Define an enum to represent the weapons an enemy might have: `none`, `sword`, `rubberMallet` and so on. Change the struct definition to use your new enum instead of a `Bool`.
